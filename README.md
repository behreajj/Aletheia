# Aletheia

![Screen Capture](screenCap.png)

A work-in-progress dark theme for Aseprite. Tested in version 1.3 beta. For more about themes, including installation instructions, see the [documentation](https://www.aseprite.org/docs/extensions/themes/). This theme is designed for 100% `Screen Scaling`, 200% `UI Elements Scaling`. This can be changed under `Edit > Preferences > General`. If some UI elements do not change after the theme is `Select`ed in `Edit > Preferences > Theme`, go to `View > Refresh & Reload Skin`.

Key differences:
- Highlight blue is more saturated.
- Wider sprite tabs.
- Open padlock for editable layers.
- Empty cels do not have circles.
- Red-blue color onion skin frame on timeline.
- Timeline docking and onion skin icons.
- Smaller cursor. (Native cursor is recommended.)
- Smaller transform cursors: rotate, scale, skew.
- Aseprite face icon is same as light theme.
- Selected radio buttons are more distinct.
- Combo box menu dimensions.
- Palette preset dropdown link icons.
